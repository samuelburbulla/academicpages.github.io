[continuiti](https://github.com/aai-institute/continuiti)
is a Python package for deep learning on function operators with a focus on elegance and generality. It provides a unified interface for neural operators (such as DeepONet or FNO) to be used in a plug and play fashion. As operator learning is particularly useful in scientific machine learning, continuiti also includes physics-informed loss functions and a collection of relevant benchmarks.
