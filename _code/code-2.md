I'm one of the core developers of [DUNE](https://dune-project.org),
a modular toolbox for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) with grid-based methods.

[Dune-MMesh](https://dune-mmesh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is my own DUNE grid 
implementation tailored for numerical applications with moving physical
interfaces and mixed-dimensional partial differential equations.
