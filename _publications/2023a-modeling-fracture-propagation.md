We present a novel model for fluid-driven fracture propagation in poro-elastic
media. Our approach combines ideas from dimensionally reduced discrete fracture
models with diffuse phase-field models. The main advantage of this combined
approach is that the fracture geometry is always represented explicitly, while
the propagation remains geometrically flexible. We prove that our model is
thermodynamically consistent. In order to solve our model numerically, we
propose a mixed-dimensional discontinuous Galerkin scheme with a computational
grid fully conforming to the fractures. As the fracture propagates, the diffuse
phase-field acts as indicator to identify new fracture facets to be added to the
discrete fracture network. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our approach
reproduces classical scenarios for fracturing porous media.
