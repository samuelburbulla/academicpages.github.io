We study single-phase flow in a fractured porous medium at a macroscopic scale
that allows us to model fractures individually. The flow is governed by Darcy’s
law in both fractures and a porous matrix. We derive a new mixed-dimensional
model, where fractures are represented by (n-1)-dimensional interfaces between
n-dimensional subdomains for n>=2. In particular, we suggest a generalization of the
model in [V. Martin, J. Jaffré, and J. E. Roberts, SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 26
(2005), pp. 1667–1691] by accounting for asymmetric fractures with spatially
varying aperture. Thus, the new model is particularly convenient for the
description of surface roughness or for modeling curvilinear or winding
fractures. The wellposedness of the new model is proven under appropriate
conditions. Further, we formulate a discontinuous Galerkin discretization of the
new model and validate the model by performing two- and three-dimensional
numerical experiments.
