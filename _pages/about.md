I am an applied mathematician with a PhD in mathematical modelling
and numerical simulation - and enthusiastic about everything that makes
machines intelligent!

Currently, I'm working at [TransferLab](https://transferlab.ai) on the
application of machine learning to the simulation of physical systems.
This includes physics-informed machine learning, operator learning and other 
approaches to scientific ML.
