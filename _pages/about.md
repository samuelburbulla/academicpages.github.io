I am Samuel, an applied mathematician with a PhD in mathematical modeling
and numerical simulation - and enthusiastic about everything that makes
machines intelligent!

Currently, I'm working at the [TransferLab](https://transferlab.ai) of
the [appliedAI Institute for Europe](https://appliedai-institute.de)
on the application of machine learning to the simulation of physical systems.
This includes physics-informed machine learning, operator learning and other 
approaches to scientific ML.

With the rest of my time, I enjoy traveling and hiking the Alps
with my wife, or playing the drums at ICF Munich.
